## Abstract

This EIP proposes a standard interface for Non-Fungible Agents (NFAs), a new token type that extends ERC-721 to support autonomous agent functionality. NFAs embed agentic logic, evolving personas, and media identity into tokens, enabling a new class of intelligent digital assets on Ethereum.

The ERC-007 standard addresses critical gaps in existing token frameworks by providing standardized interfaces for autonomous behavior, cross-platform agent interactions, and secure hybrid on-chain/off-chain architectures. This standardization enables an interoperable ecosystem where agents can maintain consistent identity and capabilities across diverse applications while optimizing for both security and rich functionality.

## Motivation

Traditional NFTs are static digital assets with limited interactivity. While they excel at representing ownership of digital items, they lack the capability to act autonomously or maintain evolving state. This limitation prevents NFTs from representing more complex entities like intelligent agents, autonomous services, or evolving digital beings.

While the Ethereum ecosystem has seen numerous implementations of "intelligent" or "autonomous" tokens, these solutions have been fragmented, incompatible, and often reinvent core infrastructure patterns. This fragmentation creates several critical problems:

1. **Integration Complexity**: Each project implements its own interfaces, requiring custom integration work for every new agent type.

2. **Limited Interoperability**: Agents from different developers cannot easily interact or compose with each other.

3. **Inconsistent Security Models**: Each implementation uses different approaches to permissions and access control.

4. **Duplicated Infrastructure**: Developers waste resources building the same foundational components repeatedly.

ERC-007 addresses these challenges by providing a standardized framework that enables:

- **Consistent Agent Interfaces**: Common methods for action execution, state management, and logic upgrades.
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Agents that maintain their identity and capabilities across different applications.
- **Unified Security Patterns**: Standardized circuit breaker and permission systems.
- **Developer Acceleration**: Focus on unique agent behaviors rather than infrastructure.

This standardization is essential for creating a thriving ecosystem where agents can be composed, traded, and evolved across multiple platforms and use cases.

## Specification

The ERC-007 standard introduces several key components:

### Core Interface

```solidity
interface IERC007 {
    enum Status { Active, Paused, Terminated }
    
    struct State {
        uint256 balance;
        Status status;
        address owner;
        address logicAddress;
        uint256 lastActionTimestamp;
    }

    struct AgentMetadata {
        string persona;       // JSON-encoded string for character traits, style, tone
        string memory;        // Short summary string for agent's role/purpose
        string voiceHash;     // Reference ID to stored audio profile
        string animationURI;  // URI to video or animation file
        string vaultURI;      // URI to the agent's vault (extended data storage)
        bytes32 vaultHash;    // Hash of the vault contents for verification
    }
    
    event ActionExecuted(address indexed agent, bytes result);
    event LogicUpgraded(address indexed agent, address oldLogic, address newLogic);
    event AgentFunded(address indexed agent, address indexed funder, uint256 amount);
    event StatusChanged(address indexed agent, Status newStatus);
    event MetadataUpdated(uint256 indexed tokenId, string metadataURI);
    event MemoryModuleRegistered(uint256 indexed tokenId, address indexed moduleAddress);
    
    function createAgent(
        address to, 
        address logicAddress, 
        string memory metadataURI,
        AgentMetadata memory extendedMetadata
    ) external returns (uint256 tokenId);
    
    function createAgent(
        address to, 
        address logicAddress, 
        string memory metadataURI
    ) external returns (uint256 tokenId);
    
    function executeAction(uint256 tokenId, bytes calldata data) external;
    function setLogicAddress(uint256 tokenId, address newLogic) external;
    function fundAgent(uint256 tokenId) external payable;
    function getState(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (State memory);
    function getAgentMetadata(uint256 tokenId) external view returns (AgentMetadata memory);
    function updateAgentMetadata(uint256 tokenId, AgentMetadata memory metadata) external;
    function registerMemoryModule(uint256 tokenId, address moduleAddress) external;
    function pause(uint256 tokenId) external;
    function unpause(uint256 tokenId) external;
    function terminate(uint256 tokenId) external;
}
```

### Extended Metadata

ERC-007 defines an extended metadata structure that includes:

1. **persona**: A JSON-encoded string representing character traits, style, tone, and behavioral intent.
2. **memory**: A short summary string describing the agent's default role or purpose.
3. **voiceHash**: A reference ID to a stored audio profile (e.g., via IPFS or Arweave).
4. **animationURI**: A URI to a video or animation file.
5. **vaultURI**: A URI to the agent's vault (extended data storage).
6. **vaultHash**: A hash of the vault contents for verification.

### Agent Logic

Agents execute actions through a delegatecall pattern to their logic contract. This allows for:

1. **Upgradable Behavior**: Owners can update the logic address to change the agent's behavior.
2. **Specialized Templates**: Different agent types can use different logic contracts.
3. **Shared State**: The logic contract operates within the context of the agent's storage.

### Memory Modules

ERC-007 includes a registry for external memory modules:

1. **Registration**: Owners can register approved memory modules for their agents.
2. **Verification**: Memory modules are verified using cryptographic signatures.
3. **Access Control**: Owners control which applications can access their agent's memory.

### Security Features

The standard includes several security features:

1. **Circuit Breaker**: A global pause mechanism for emergency situations.
2. **Status Management**: Individual agents can be paused or terminated.
3. **Gas Limits**: Protection against out-of-gas attacks during action execution.

## Rationale

### Hybrid Architecture

ERC-007 uses a hybrid on-chain/off-chain architecture to balance several competing concerns:

1. **Gas Efficiency**: Only essential identity and security information is stored on-chain.
2. **Rich Functionality**: Complex behaviors and memory are stored off-chain.
3. **Security**: Critical operations and ownership are secured by blockchain consensus.
4. **Privacy**: Sensitive agent data can be kept private while still being verifiable.

This hybrid approach ensures that agents can be both secure and feature-rich without prohibitive gas costs.

### Delegatecall Pattern

The standard uses delegatecall for action execution to enable:

1. **Shared Context**: Logic contracts operate within the agent's storage context.
2. **Upgradability**: Logic can be upgraded without losing the agent's state.
3. **Specialization**: Different agent types can use different logic contracts.

### Extended Metadata

The extended metadata structure supports rich agent identities:

1. **Persona**: Enables consistent character traits across applications.
2. **Voice and Animation**: Supports multimedia agent representations.
3. **Vault References**: Connects on-chain identity to off-chain memory.

### Memory Module Registry

The memory module registry enables:

1. **Continuity**: Agents can maintain memory across different applications.
2. **Verification**: Applications can verify the authenticity of agent memory.
3. **Access Control**: Owners control which applications can access their agent's memory.

## Backwards Compatibility

ERC-007 is fully compatible with ERC-721, inheriting all its functionality including:

1. **Ownership**: Standard ownership and transfer mechanisms.
2. **Approvals**: Support for approvals and operator approvals.
3. **Metadata**: Support for token URIs and metadata.
4. **Enumeration**: Support for enumeration of tokens.

This ensures that ERC-007 tokens can be used with existing NFT infrastructure, including marketplaces, wallets, and other applications.

## Security Considerations

### Delegatecall Risks

The use of delegatecall for action execution introduces several security considerations:

1. **Gas Limits**: The standard includes a gas limit for delegatecall to prevent out-of-gas attacks.
2. **Logic Validation**: Implementations should validate logic contracts before setting them.
3. **Reentrancy**: The standard includes reentrancy protection for action execution.

### Circuit Breaker

The standard includes a circuit breaker mechanism to mitigate potential vulnerabilities:

1. **Global Pause**: A governance-controlled global pause for emergency situations.
2. **Individual Pause**: Owners can pause individual agents if issues are detected.

### Memory Verification

The standard includes mechanisms for verifying off-chain memory:

1. **Hash Verification**: Vault contents are verified using cryptographic hashes.
2. **Signature Verification**: Memory modules are verified using owner signatures.

### Access Control

The standard includes strict access control for sensitive operations:

1. **Owner-Only Operations**: Critical operations are restricted to the agent's owner.
2. **Governance Operations**: Protocol-level operations are restricted to the governance contract.
