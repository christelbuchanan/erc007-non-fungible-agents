# ERC-007 Architecture

This document outlines the architecture of the ERC-007 standard and its reference implementation.

## System Overview

ERC-007 is designed as a layered architecture with clear separation of concerns:

## Core Components

### ERC007.sol

The main contract that implements the ERC-007 standard. It inherits from ERC-721 and adds:

- Agent creation and management
- Action execution via delegatecall
- Extended metadata storage
- State tracking for agents

### AgentFactory.sol

Factory contract for deploying new agent tokens with customizable templates:

- Template-based agent creation
- Batch minting capabilities
- Fee collection for agent creation

### MemoryModuleRegistry.sol

Registry for managing external memory modules:

- Module registration and verification
- Access control for memory modules
- Cross-platform memory coordination

### CircuitBreaker.sol

Emergency shutdown mechanism:

- Global pause capability
- Targeted agent pause
- Governance-controlled safety measures

### ERC007Governance.sol

Governance contract for protocol-level decisions:

- Protocol parameter updates
- Fee management
- Upgrade coordination

### ERC007Treasury.sol

Treasury management for fee collection and distribution:

- Fee collection from agent operations
- Distribution to stakeholders
- Protocol funding management

### VaultPermissionManager.sol

Manages secure access to off-chain data vaults:

- Time-based permission delegation
- Cryptographic access control
- Revocation mechanisms

## Data Flow

1. **Agent Creation**:
   - User calls `createAgent` on ERC007 or AgentFactory
   - Agent is minted with specified logic and metadata
   - Initial state is established

2. **Action Execution**:
   - User calls `executeAction` with action data
   - Contract verifies agent status and permissions
   - Delegatecall to logic contract executes the action
   - Results are emitted and state is updated

3. **Memory Access**:
   - Applications request memory access through VaultPermissionManager
   - Owner-approved permissions are verified
   - Cryptographic access is granted for specified duration
   - Memory integrity is verified via on-chain hashes

## Security Model

ERC-007 implements a multi-layered security model:

1. **Ownership Security**:
   - Standard ERC-721 ownership and transfer mechanisms
   - Owner-only access to critical agent functions

2. **Execution Security**:
   - Gas limits on delegatecall to prevent attacks
   - Circuit breaker for emergency situations
   - Status management for individual agents

3. **Memory Security**:
   - Cryptographic verification of memory integrity
   - Owner-controlled access to agent memory
   - Time-limited permission delegation

4. **Governance Security**:
   - Multi-signature requirements for critical operations
   - Timelock mechanisms for parameter changes
   - Emergency response capabilities

## Upgrade Path

ERC-007 is designed for forward compatibility:

1. **Logic Upgrades**:
   - Agents can upgrade their logic contracts
   - New capabilities can be added without changing the agent's identity

2. **Protocol Upgrades**:
   - The core contracts are upgradeable via UUPS pattern
   - Governance controls the upgrade process
   - State is preserved during upgrades

3. **Extension Mechanism**:
   - The standard includes hooks for future extensions
   - New modules can be added without breaking existing functionality

## Integration Points

Applications can integrate with ERC-007 through several interfaces:

1. **Token Interface**:
   - Standard ERC-721 methods for ownership and transfers
   - Extended methods for agent-specific functionality

2. **Action Interface**:
   - Methods for executing agent actions
   - Events for monitoring agent activity

3. **Memory Interface**:
   - Registry for accessing agent memory
   - Permission system for secure access

4. **Template Interface**:
   - Factory methods for creating agents from templates
   - Customization options for agent behavior
