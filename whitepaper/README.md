## About ERC-007

ERC-007 extends the ERC-721 standard to support autonomous agent functionality. NFAs embed agentic logic, evolving personas, and media identity into tokens, enabling a new class of intelligent digital assets on Ethereum.

The standard addresses critical gaps in existing token frameworks by providing standardized interfaces for autonomous behavior, cross-platform agent interactions, and secure hybrid on-chain/off-chain architectures.

## Key Features

- **Autonomous Behavior**: Agents can execute actions based on their logic contracts
- **Evolving Memory**: Agents maintain memory that evolves over time
- **Cross-Platform Identity**: Agents maintain consistent identity across applications
- **Hybrid Architecture**: Balances on-chain security with off-chain intelligence
- **Standardized Interfaces**: Common methods for action execution and state management

## Getting Started

To learn more about ERC-007, start with the [Abstract](./abstract.md) and [Introduction](./introduction.md), then explore the technical details in the subsequent sections.

For developers interested in implementing ERC-007, refer to the [Smart Contract Architecture](./smart-contract-architecture.md) section and the reference implementation in the `/contracts` directory.
