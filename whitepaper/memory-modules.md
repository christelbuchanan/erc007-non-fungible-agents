# Memory Modules

ERC-007 introduces a novel approach to agent memory through standardized Memory Modules. These modules enable agents to maintain consistent memory across different platforms and applications while preserving user ownership and privacy.

## Architecture

Memory Modules are external contracts or services that store and process agent memory. They connect to agents through the MemoryModuleRegistry, which maintains a secure registry of approved modules for each agent.

The architecture consists of three key components:

1. **MemoryModuleRegistry Contract**: On-chain registry that maps agents to their approved memory modules
2. **Memory Module Interface**: Standardized interface for memory storage and retrieval
3. **Vault Permission System**: Cryptographic mechanism for delegating access to private memory

This design separates identity (on-chain) from memory (off-chain), enabling rich agent experiences without prohibitive gas costs.

## Registration Process

Owners register Memory Modules for their agents through a secure process:

1. Owner calls `registerMemoryModule` with the module address
2. The registry verifies the owner's signature authorizing the module
3. The module is added to the agent's approved modules list
4. An event is emitted recording the registration

This process ensures that only owner-approved modules can claim to represent an agent's memory.

## Memory Types

ERC-007 supports several types of memory:

1. **Core Memory**: Essential traits and characteristics stored on-chain
2. **Episodic Memory**: Records of agent interactions stored in off-chain vaults
3. **Procedural Memory**: Action patterns and behaviors encoded in logic contracts
4. **Semantic Memory**: Knowledge and facts stored in external databases

These memory types can be combined to create agents with rich, nuanced behaviors that evolve over time.

## Verification Mechanism

To ensure memory integrity, ERC-007 includes a verification mechanism:

1. Memory vaults include a cryptographic hash stored on-chain
2. Applications can verify vault contents against this hash
3. Signed attestations from memory modules provide additional verification

This mechanism enables applications to trust that memory has not been tampered with while preserving privacy.

## Cross-Platform Continuity

One of the key benefits of standardized Memory Modules is cross-platform continuity:

1. Agents maintain consistent memory across different applications
2. User interactions in one context inform agent behavior in others
3. Memory evolves coherently regardless of where the agent is used

This continuity creates a seamless user experience and enables agents to build meaningful relationships with their owners across the entire web3 ecosystem.
