# Abstract

Non-Fungible Agents (NFAs) represent a new frontier in tokenized intelligence. As an extension of the ERC-721 standard, NFAs embed agentic logic, evolving personas, and media identity into a novel token framework proposed as ERC-007 on Ethereum.

This paper outlines the architecture, use cases, revenue model, and long-term vision for NFAs as a foundational layer for memory-native applications and composable on-chain agents.

The ERC-007 standard addresses critical gaps in existing token frameworks by providing standardized interfaces for autonomous behavior, cross-platform agent interactions, and secure hybrid on-chain/off-chain architectures. This standardization enables an interoperable ecosystem where agents can maintain consistent identity and capabilities across diverse applications while optimizing for both security and rich functionality.
