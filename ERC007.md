# ERC-007: Non-Fungible Agent Standard

ERC-007 is a proposed Ethereum token standard that extends ERC-721 to support autonomous agent functionality. This standard enables the creation of Non-Fungible Agents (NFAs) - tokens that combine unique identity with autonomous behavior, evolving memory, and rich media representation.

## Overview

Traditional NFTs are static digital assets with limited interactivity. ERC-007 introduces a new paradigm where tokens can:

1. Execute autonomous actions through logic contracts
2. Maintain evolving memory across different platforms
3. Present consistent identity through standardized metadata
4. Interact with users and other agents in meaningful ways

This standard creates a foundation for a new generation of intelligent digital assets that maintain consistent identity and capabilities across diverse applications.

## Key Components

### Core Token Standard

ERC-007 inherits from ERC-721 and adds several key extensions:

- **Action Execution**: Methods for executing agent actions
- **Logic Management**: Upgradable logic contracts for agent behavior
- **State Tracking**: On-chain storage of essential agent state
- **Extended Metadata**: Rich metadata for agent identity

### Memory Module System

The standard includes a registry for external memory modules:

- **Registration**: Owners can register approved memory modules
- **Verification**: Cryptographic verification of memory integrity
- **Access Control**: Owner-controlled access to agent memory

### Security Framework

ERC-007 incorporates several security features:

- **Circuit Breaker**: Emergency pause mechanism
- **Status Management**: Individual agent status control
- **Gas Limits**: Protection against out-of-gas attacks

## Use Cases

ERC-007 enables a wide range of use cases:

- **Personal Assistants**: Agents that help users with tasks and information
- **Game Characters**: NPCs with persistent identity and memory
- **Creative Collaborators**: Agents that assist with content creation
- **DeFi Strategists**: Agents that execute financial strategies
- **Social Entities**: Agents that interact with users and other agents

## Getting Started

To start working with ERC-007:

1. Review the [EIP specification](./EIPS/eip-007.md)
2. Explore the [reference implementation](./contracts/ERC007.sol)
3. Check out the [documentation](./docs/)

## Development Status

ERC-007 is currently in draft status. The standard is being developed through the Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) process.
