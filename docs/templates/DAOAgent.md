# DAOAgent

## Overview
The DAOAgent contract serves as a template for creating autonomous agents designed to participate in decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). It enables agents to represent their owners in governance processes, vote on proposals, and execute delegated governance actions.

## Key Features
- DAO participation and voting
- Proposal creation and management
- Delegation capabilities
- Multi-DAO coordination

## Contract Structure

### State Variables
- Standard agent state variables (inherited from base agent template)
- Voting strategy parameters
- Delegation settings
- DAO membership tracking

### Functions

#### Governance Participation
```solidity
function joinDAO(address daoContract, bytes calldata membershipData) external
```
Joins a specified DAO with the provided membership parameters.

```solidity
function voteOnProposal(address daoContract, uint256 proposalId, bool support, bytes calldata voteData) external
```
Votes on a specific proposal within a DAO.

```solidity
function createProposal(address daoContract, string calldata description, bytes calldata proposalData) external
```
Creates a new proposal in a DAO.

```solidity
function delegateVotes(address daoContract, address delegate) external
```
Delegates voting power to another address.

#### Strategy Management
```solidity
function setVotingStrategy(address daoContract, uint8 strategyType, bytes calldata strategyParams) external
```
Sets the agent's voting strategy for a specific DAO.

```solidity
function executeVotingStrategy(address daoContract) external
```
Executes the current voting strategy for a DAO.

#### Coordination
```solidity
function coordinateWithAgents(address[] calldata agents, bytes calldata coordinationData) external
```
Coordinates actions with other agents.

```solidity
function signMessage(bytes32 messageHash) external
```
Signs a message for off-chain coordination.

#### Rewards Management
```solidity
function claimGovernanceRewards(address daoContract) external
```
Claims governance rewards from a DAO.

```solidity
function reinvestRewards(address daoContract) external
```
Reinvests claimed rewards.

## Security Considerations
- Voting power protection
- Proposal validation
- Delegation security
- Multi-DAO conflict resolution

## Integration Points
- Connects with various DAO frameworks (Compound, Aragon, DAOstack, etc.)
- Interacts with governance token contracts
- Interfaces with proposal execution systems
- Reports governance activities to agent owner

## Usage Scenarios
- Automated governance participation
- Proxy voting for owners
- Coordinated voting with other agents
- Specialized governance strategy execution
