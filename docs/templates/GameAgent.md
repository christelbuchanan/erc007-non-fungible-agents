# GameAgent

## Overview
The GameAgent contract serves as a template for creating autonomous agents designed to interact with blockchain games and metaverse applications. It enables agents to represent players in games, manage in-game assets, and execute game-specific strategies autonomously.

## Key Features
- Game interaction capabilities
- In-game asset management
- Character progression automation
- Cross-game interoperability

## Contract Structure

### State Variables
- Standard agent state variables (inherited from base agent template)
- Game-specific state tracking
- Character/avatar attributes
- Inventory management

### Functions

#### Game Interactions
```solidity
function joinGame(address gameContract, bytes calldata gameData) external
```
Joins a specified game with the provided parameters.

```solidity
function executeGameAction(address gameContract, uint256 actionId, bytes calldata actionData) external
```
Executes a specific action within a game.

```solidity
function claimRewards(address gameContract) external
```
Claims rewards from a game.

#### Asset Management
```solidity
function equipItem(uint256 itemId) external
```
Equips an item to the agent's character.

```solidity
function tradeItem(address counterparty, uint256 outgoingItemId, uint256 incomingItemId) external
```
Trades items with another player or agent.

```solidity
function craftItem(uint256[] calldata ingredientIds, uint256 recipeId) external
```
Crafts a new item using ingredients and a recipe.

#### Strategy Management
```solidity
function setGameStrategy(address gameContract, uint8 strategyType, bytes calldata strategyParams) external
```
Sets the agent's strategy for a specific game.

```solidity
function executeStrategy(address gameContract) external
```
Executes the current strategy for a game.

#### Social Interactions
```solidity
function joinGuild(address guildContract, bytes calldata membershipData) external
```
Joins a guild or player organization.

```solidity
function sendMessage(address recipient, bytes calldata message) external
```
Sends an in-game message to another player or agent.

## Security Considerations
- Game-specific security measures
- Asset protection mechanisms
- Anti-cheating compliance
- Rate limiting for actions

## Integration Points
- Connects with blockchain game contracts
- Interacts with NFT marketplaces for in-game items
- Interfaces with guild/DAO contracts
- Reports game progress to agent owner

## Usage Scenarios
- Automated resource gathering
- 24/7 character presence in persistent worlds
- Competitive gameplay automation
- In-game economy participation
