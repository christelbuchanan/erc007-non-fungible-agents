# DeFiAgent

## Overview
The DeFiAgent contract serves as a template for creating autonomous agents specialized in decentralized finance (DeFi) operations. It provides a framework for agents to interact with various DeFi protocols, manage assets, and execute financial strategies on behalf of their owners.

## Key Features
- DeFi protocol interactions (swaps, lending, borrowing)
- Portfolio management capabilities
- Yield optimization strategies
- Risk management controls

## Contract Structure

### State Variables
- Standard agent state variables (inherited from base agent template)
- DeFi-specific configuration parameters
- Protocol interaction settings
- Risk tolerance parameters

### Functions

#### Core DeFi Operations
```solidity
function executeSwap(address tokenIn, address tokenOut, uint256 amount) external
```
Executes a token swap on a configured DEX.

```solidity
function provideLiquidity(address pool, uint256 amount) external
```
Provides liquidity to a specified pool.

```solidity
function stake(address stakingContract, uint256 amount) external
```
Stakes tokens in a yield-generating protocol.

```solidity
function borrow(address lendingPlatform, address asset, uint256 amount) external
```
Borrows assets from a lending platform.

```solidity
function repay(address lendingPlatform, address asset, uint256 amount) external
```
Repays borrowed assets.

#### Strategy Management
```solidity
function setStrategy(uint8 strategyType, bytes calldata strategyParams) external
```
Sets the agent's DeFi strategy.

```solidity
function executeStrategy() external
```
Executes the current strategy.

```solidity
function harvestYield() external
```
Harvests yield from active positions.

#### Risk Management
```solidity
function setRiskParameters(uint256 maxLTV, uint256 stopLoss) external
```
Sets risk management parameters.

```solidity
function emergencyWithdraw(address token) external
```
Emergency withdrawal function for risk mitigation.

## Security Considerations
- Slippage protection for swaps
- Liquidation risk monitoring
- Protocol risk diversification
- Emergency circuit breakers

## Integration Points
- Interacts with DEXs (Uniswap, PancakeSwap, etc.)
- Connects with lending platforms (Aave, Compound, etc.)
- Utilizes yield aggregators
- Reports to agent owner via events

## Usage Scenarios
- Automated yield farming
- Dollar-cost averaging investment
- Liquidity provision management
- Collateralized debt position (CDP) management
