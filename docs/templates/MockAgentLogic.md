# MockAgentLogic

## Overview
The MockAgentLogic contract serves as a test template for the BEP-007 ecosystem, providing a simplified implementation of agent logic for testing and demonstration purposes. It implements basic functionality to validate the agent interaction model without complex business logic.

## Key Features
- Basic agent operations for testing
- Simplified state management
- Event logging for verification
- Test-friendly interfaces

## Contract Structure

### State Variables
- Test-specific state variables
- Counters for tracking operations
- Mock data storage

### Functions

#### Basic Operations
```solidity
function performAction(string calldata actionName) external
```
Performs a named action and emits an event.

```solidity
function storeData(string calldata key, string calldata value) external
```
Stores key-value data in the agent's state.

```solidity
function retrieveData(string calldata key) external view returns (string memory)
```
Retrieves stored data by key.

#### Test Utilities
```solidity
function incrementCounter() external returns (uint256)
```
Increments and returns an internal counter.

```solidity
function emitTestEvent(string calldata message) external
```
Emits a test event with a custom message.

```solidity
function simulateFailure() external
```
Deliberately fails to test error handling.

#### Mock Interactions
```solidity
function mockExternalCall(address target, bytes calldata data) external returns (bool, bytes memory)
```
Simulates calling an external contract.

```solidity
function mockTokenTransfer(address token, address recipient, uint256 amount) external returns (bool)
```
Simulates a token transfer operation.

## Security Considerations
- Limited to testing environments
- No real value transfers
- Simplified security model

## Integration Points
- Used with BEP007 contract for testing
- Interacts with test harnesses
- Provides verification points for test cases

## Usage Scenarios
- Unit testing the BEP007 contract
- Integration testing the agent ecosystem
- Demonstrating agent capabilities
- Onboarding developers to the platform
